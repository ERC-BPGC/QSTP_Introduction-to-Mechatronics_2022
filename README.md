# QSTP Introduction To Mechatronics

This repository contains all reading materials from the mechatronics summer course taught by [Archit Rungta](https://github.com/archit2604), [Avinandan Nag](https://github.com/Avinandan2604) and [Yash Jangir](https://github.com/offjangir), as part of the QSTP initiative. The goal of this content is to provide a moderate introduction to electronics, Arduino and CAD modelling for beginners. The course requires no hardware, and the Arduino part is completed using TinkerCAD, a free online circuit simulator.

*PS: If you are a beginner interested in learning electronics and Arduino program, `Electronics Week` of this course is a great place to get started.*

## Course Structure

This course is split up into 2 independent modules:

1. **CAD Modelling:** Covers basic 3D designing using Fusion360.
2. **Electronics and Arduino:** Covers the basics of electronics and Arduino, from using a breadboard to controlling LCD displays.

### What is QSTP?

Quark Summer Technical Projects (QSTP) is a platform where experienced BITS students (currently in their 2/3/4th year); part of the clubs or independently; mentor Project-centric Courses for other students over the summer. This course will start from 6th July 2021.

Quark Summer Technical Projects (QSTP) in association with GDG (Google Developers Group) & WTM (Women Techmakers) Goa is open for participation from all students irrespective of their branch and year of study.
